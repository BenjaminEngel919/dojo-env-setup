  2. Setting Up Your dojo-env Environment
 </h1>
 <h2>
  Step 2 Overview:
 </h2>
 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    In Step 1, we installed the foundational tools needed for our local python installation.
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     While we did install a Python distribution with a basic copy of Python (Anaconda or miniforge), we have not installed all of the packages and tools that we need as data scientists.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
   <strong>
    In Step 2, you will be creating a custom python environment called "dojo-env".
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      An "environment" is a bundle of specific python packages that are used together.
     </strong>
     Importantly, an environment specifies specific version #'s of the packages to ensure that all of the versions installed are mutually compatible.
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      You can install many environments
     </strong>
     on your computer and switch between them as needed for different projects.
    </li>
   </ul>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      We have designed the dojo-env to include everything you'd need for our program
     </strong>
     , so you may not have a reason to add additional environments.
    </li>
   </ul>
  </li>
 </ul>

 <ul>
  <li>
   <strong>
    We have prepared environment files (.yml files) for 3 different OS configurations:
   </strong>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Windows (10 &amp; 11)
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Mac (with Intel processors)
     </strong>
    </li>
    <li>
     <strong>
      Mac (Apple Chips).

     </strong>

   </ul>
  </li>

   Reminder for mac users:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Please revisit the "1. Downloading and Installing Apps" lesson if you are not sure which type of mac you are using.

   Note to Linux Users:
   <ul>
    <li>
     Our Linux installation instructions are still in beta. While they have successfully been installed on students' Linux machines, we currently do not have a Linux machine available for troubleshooting.
    </li>
    <li>
     The beta Linux instructions are located
     <a href="https://login.codingdojo.com/m/213/13909/99742" target="_blank">
      here
     </a>
     and all steps are combined into 1 lesson.
    </li>
    <li>
     If you run into issues during installation, post your questions/issues on the
